and at the servery, and we were led to tables that werent free more than onceThe decor is also fairly dated, with a 1970s feel to some of the public areas ,  the lounge bar has the ability to be good but is often used as a waiting area by people, occupying tables without having a drink, and doesnt work as some bars in lobby areas do at other hotels ,  the main bar is like a pub, and doesnt feel like part of the hotel .\\n104

service was very very inefficient ,  requesting a menu to be brought to the room took 45 minutes and the guy actually had the audacity to suggest he read it to me over the phone instead of sending one up, after I had to call three times .\\n481

at $9 .\\n10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The difference between the books I've purchased and the price of the Kindle is about $166 .\\n11

often more expensive , ,  particularly new releases .\\n12

Konrath are offering novels at prices ranging from $1 to $2 dollars, as a way to find new readers .\\n14

effectively dropped to $349 .\\n15

                                                                                                       I would have been glad to have paid any price to have had a book reader that was easier to read for myself with 20 20 vision and especially for the low, vision reader .\\n17

                                                                                                                                                                                the BUT comes in and applies to the fact that the price for the downloads has been going up and up .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                                 since the cost of the kindle is high anyway, the benefit, other than easy storage, was the reduced price of book downloads .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                                 The lack of such an obvious and necessary feature, especially considering the price of the device, really degrades its value and usability .\\n24                                                 I want you to know that ultimately, however, if I want a Kindle I will have to capitulate and accept Amazon's terms because Amazon has a monopoly over their own machine, and I will have to purchase one even at prices I believe are needlessly high for e, book readers .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                And I know for sure that many print publishers will see this as an opportunity to provide attractively priced paper books as an alternative .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  At the steep price of this device we should get better quality components .\\n27                                                                                                                            To have this continuous, high speed, wireless connectivity without the need for a physical computer to upload download onto is truly amazing and makes the price of the Kindle truly irrelevant .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                     price  , and intuitive operation your parents and grandparents can operate this device, if you are fortunate enough to still have them !\\n29

drop so that I could give myself the excuse to purchase it .\\n30

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The price for new hardbacks on the Kindle is great too .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               After reading the reviews and pondering the price all day, I took the plunge .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                             The ability to plug in headphones and play Miles Davis to drown out the screaming kid while you are reading at the doctors office is priceless .\\n34                                                                                                                                                       If you are searching for a REAL review on the Kindle 2 by someone that was waiting to receive it rather than complaining about price or other issues then here it is .\\n35                          However, I will say, the selection of inexpensive books has been worth the purchase price of this item  especially for those that enjoy reading the classics or nationwide news, it has been a joy to purchase entire collections for a fraction of the cost of purchasing new or even used books .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                           Those in college, with children or just have a love of reading will likely find the convenience and savings well worth the price .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I found many simply by doing a search on genre's of interest with price  low to high  as a default .\\n38

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The price of these 'classic' titles is pretty hard to beat, too .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                            I was a little miffed when i saw that they would now be charging for the Kindle cover, which was included in the price for the previous version .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                              Mind you, it's the same size as the Kindle 1, and that of most book pages, but I for one dream of something larger without a larger price tag .\\n42

with a K1 still in hand I would have probably waited .\\n43

                                                                                                                                                                   But, as far as my reading experience with the kindle 2, I have downloaded so many books and all at a fraction of the original price .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I just hope that the price goes down .\\n46                                                                                                                                            Yes, it costs extra, but they lowered the price on the Kindle 2 so that buying the basic cover costs plus the purchase price of the device itself equals the cost of a Kindle 1 .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                         But given my book storage issues and how much it would cost me to rent a bigger apartment here in the City, I didn't mind paying the current price .\\n48

                                                                                                                                                                       Some people may find this an inconvenience, but I think it is just a small price to pay for delayed convenience especially where I am located .\\n50

     Books are retardedly pricey .\\n51

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Even if you want to , I think it is way too pricey .\\n53

.\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Though it would be nice if the cover was included in the K2 price, it is still worth buying .\\n55

a year due to the low cost of most books .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                The price of the device itself is the only drawback but if your an avid reader like myself the reward far outways the price .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                        The price, tag is pretty hefty for most people, though I would counter that the value proposition makes up for it   .\\n58

down .\\n59

significantly so, while 5 were not available on B&N at all .\\n61

original Kindle was released, I was intrigued, but never researched it due to the insanely high price tag .\\n63

             I checked the difference in price between the cheapest print available of the books and the Kindle Editions .\\n68

                                                 she thought she wanted one, but was a bit daunted by the price and the question of how much she would actually use it .\\n70

thought i would go with the B&N Nook until i compared book prices between B&N and Amazon .\\n71

my opinion .\\n72

                                        The bigger size has taken some getting used to, but the additional horsepower compared to the '02 and the performance are like night and day .\\n19                                                                                                                             It fits right , is fun to drive, great stereo, fuel economy, performance .\\n20

                                                          I researched many other makes and models but for the performance, quality, and style, the accord won hands down for cars under $32,000 .\\n23

reliability .\\n25                                                                                                                                                            No problem with quality,

and the gas saving is only minimal .\\n29                                                                                                                                                  The car is

could do any better with design or performance .\\n31

luxury, feel car with great performance at a good price .\\n33                                        Overweight ,  3600 pounds, lots of road noise, and the combined performance of the VCM and the grade logic automatic transmission mke this a miserable driver .\\n34                                                                                                                                 The interior design and the performance of the V6 are the highlights .\\n35                                                                                                        I was looking for a

            It does not diminish the performance of the car, it is just annoying .\\n38         After tracking almost 2 months of research on American and Japanese mid, size car models, only two stands out for their performance, reliability and safety ,  Honda Accord and Toyota Camry .\\n39                                                   My my, I have never experienced such smooth performance, stability, pick, up, mileage and comfort that I am enjoying with my new 2008 Honda Accord .\\n40                                                                                                                   I admire engine performance and comfort while driving atleast 30 mile a day to job .\\n41                                                                                  I have owned 4 honda's and have come to rely on the fantastic quality of performance and lack of maintenance issues .\\n42                                                                                                    The car is superb, performance, styling, quality, engineering, fit and finish , the whole banana  !\\n43

              When I first tested the EX, L V6, the performance and handling of the car sold me,  I had to get it and I did .\\n47

of touchscreen, lack of battery SD slot, lack of a back light, awkward difficult keyboard layout, minimally faster page flipping, and the super, high price .\\n3

                             And I know for sure that many print publishers will see this as an opportunity to provide attractively priced paper books as an alternative .\\n26

                  To have this continuous, high speed, wireless connectivity without the need for a physical computer to upload download onto is truly amazing and makes the price of the Kindle truly irrelevant .\\n28

drop so that I could give myself the excuse to purchase it .\\n30

                                             The price for new hardbacks on the Kindle is great too .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               After reading the reviews and pondering the price all day, I took the plunge .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                             The ability to plug in headphones and play Miles Davis to drown out the screaming kid while you are reading at the doctors office is priceless .\\n34                                                                                                                                                       If you are searching for a REAL review on the Kindle 2 by someone that was waiting to receive it rather than complaining about price or other issues then here it is .\\n35                          However, I will say, the selection of inexpensive books has been worth the purchase price of this item  especially for those that enjoy reading the classics or nationwide news, it has been a joy to purchase entire collections for a fraction of the cost of purchasing new or even used books .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                           Those in college, with children or just have a love of reading will likely find the convenience and savings well worth the price .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I found many simply by doing a search on genre's of interest with price  low to high  as a default .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     To justify the purchase price, those functions really need to be there .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The price of these 'classic' titles is pretty hard to beat, too .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                            I was a little miffed when i saw that they would now be charging for the Kindle cover, which was included in the price for the previous version .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                              Mind you, it's the same size as the Kindle 1, and that of most book pages, but I for one dream of something larger without a larger price tag .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                                 If I have to spend the full puirchase price on the K2 with a K1 still in hand I would have probably waited .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Although pricey, the real value of this purchase is that it got me to read again .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                        But, as far as my reading experience with the kindle 2, I have downloaded so many books and all at a fraction of the original price .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I just hope that the price goes down .\\n46                                                                                                                                            Yes, it costs extra, but they lowered the price on the Kindle 2 so that buying the basic cover costs plus the purchase price of the device itself equals the cost of a Kindle 1 .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                         But given my book storage issues and how much it would cost me to rent a bigger apartment here in the City, I didn't mind paying the current price .\\n48

                                                                                                                                                                       Some people may find this an inconvenience, but I think it is just a small price to pay for delayed convenience especially where I am located .\\n50

     Books are retardedly pricey .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Should have been priced at $250  .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Even if you want to , I think it is way too pricey .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The subscription prices and book prices are really good from what my wife tells me .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Though it would be nice if the cover was included in the K2 price, it is still worth buying .\\n55

a year due to the low cost of most books .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                The price of the device itself is the only drawback but if your an avid reader like myself the reward far outways the price .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                        The price, tag is pretty hefty

The transmission is horrible, it shifts revs horribly at the wrong times, it putters when it hits 1 1 2 rpms while coasting unless you rev it or hit the breaks, if you try to start the car in really cold weather it makes a horrible grinding noise, the dash rattles ALL the time, when I try to accelerate getting on the freeway it doesnt move & scares me and when it does move it revs even after take your foot from the gas .\\n6

it has almost caused me to get into an accident twice .\\n7

the common issue of the transmission that doesn't want to seem to work when you need it .\\n8

                         The thing that bothered me the most was the bathroom was very dated .\\n41

no counterspace in the bathroom at all .\\n42



                                           The bathroom was large and private .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                              The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The room was a good size but the bathroomm was very small .\\n52

Bathroom was adequate and clean and there was a hairdryer .\\n53

shower .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The bathroom had not been remodeled in alignment, but it was all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55

                Bathrooms were also very nice .\\n57

              Then they gave us a room which had a view of a wall, a tiny bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

                                     Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the

room after a night on the town .\\n11                                                                                                                                                                                                      Breakfast equally tired ,  although a reasonable selection of food, general ambience in restaurant more like a youth hostel .\\n12

.\\n17                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I ordered room service one night, and the food was delightful, and the service was fast and friendly .\\n18

close to many restaurants including fast food if you like .\\n19                                                                                                                                              Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .\\n20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                There was a massive queue for the restaurant, the food was beginning to run low we went down at 9 .\\n21

the hotel on Cromwell   Gloucester Rds .\\n22                                                                                                                                                       Room service is expensive but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a \\u00a36 .\\n23

           You could buy food from Sainsburys or Waitrose which were 2 minutes away to save money .\\n24

   There was an adequate self service buffet, not a huge selection or very well presented, cloths were not changed when food got spilt .\\n29

as long as we have you eat fast food when you get the chance !\\n30

                                Shame that we had to use the forum restaurant this morning prior to check out ,  this restaurant is on the first floor and is one of the buffet style breakfasts so

                                                                                                                                                                                             I would recommendeating out as the evening food is frozen re, heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it .\\n43

Waitrose supermarket and Tesso express mart next door .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                The area has a few pubs, a couple of steak places, a number of Indian restaurants and some fast food, so it's convenient for that .\\n45                                                                 Within 200 yards of leaving the hotel and heading to the Tube Station   you have a number of fast food outlets, highstreet Restautants, Pastry shops and supermarkets, so if you did wish to live in your hotel room for the duration of your stay, you could do !\\n46

day the food served wasnt changed .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                        We ate in the bistro downstairs and the food was very good ,  although the portions varied significantly depending on the chef that night .\\n48    The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n49

was the wrong order .\\n50

                                                                                                                                                                                  While travelling out of London to any of the popular destinations, food can be pretty expensive .\\n52

                                             Food is overpriced everywhere due to $ to pound conversion of course .\\n68

                                   More than enough food choices with coffee or tea, juice, pastries, toast, yogurt, cereal and assorted cold cuts to please every taste .\\n70

that the rooms have mini, fridges and it's great for storing ready, to, eat food from Waitrose .\\n71

fraction of the cost .\\n72

fast food if you like .\\n86                                                                                                                                                              Its location is probably the first thing worth mentioning, being a 10 minutes walk from the natural history museum, a 15 minutes walk from beautiful Hyde Park and just behind the corner of the Gloucester Road underground station   .\\n87

overall standards .\\n88

the location .\\n89                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Location is great, 5 mins walk to the Natural History Museum, 15 to Kensington High St and 2 mins to the tube and in a high room you can see for

just how comfortable it was to sit in and drive .\\n23                                                                                                                                   This car offers poor driver's seat comfort, poor vision  , only average ride quality, gas mileage \\n24                                                                        We have had this Camry about two years now, and it is not a boring car but it is smooth, comfortable and has good road manner, and overall it is a good car .\\n25                                                                                                                          I'd highly recommend anyone buy this car if they are seeking an affordable, comfortable, reliable vehicle .\\n26                                                                                                                                                     You can not get that comfort with any other automaker other than perhaps Honda .\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                Looks are great and interior is comfortable, but it ?\\n28                                                                                                                                                    I needed a comfortable commuter that I could also run around with the family in .\\n29                                                                                                                                    great ride, quiet comfortable spacious cabin, superior electronics  , fair price and good looks .\\n30                                                                                                         You can't have it both ways, either a car is full of power and stiff suspension or it's smooth and comfortable on the road .\\n31                                                                                                                                 The interior is very luxurious and comfortable, however the car feels slower than my 2002 Camry LE .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                    For the comfort and entertainment of the ride, I like the Camry .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                            The driver's seat is really comfortable .\\n34                                                                                             I have had no transmission issues or rattling, the comfort and ride of this vehicle felt to me much more high end then what I had paid .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                    I love the look, and the comfort, but would never buy one again .\\n36    I've read other reviews stating that the leather seats were not comfortable for long drives due to lack of cushion support, but that's not been the case for me especially after recently driving from Houston to Key West, Fla .\\n37

                                                                                                    The car comfort, looks, performance and fuel economy are great but the paint is a disaster .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                       Front seats are not comfortable on long trip .\\n40                                                                                                I was not sure at first about trading my 01 Honda Accord but have been more than satisfied with the performance, looks, and comfort .\\n41                                                                                                                                       A little stiffer ride than the xl and xle models I have had, but still comfortable and quiet .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                  Very comfortable ride and seating .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                 Very low interior noise level, which adds to the long trip comfort .\\n44                                                                                                The ride, comfort, and drive is as expected, however, the quality and reputation of yore are completely gone for the flagship Camry .\\n45                                                                                       Over the month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort and options of the Camry .\\n46                                                                                                     The seat comfort is not as it was and I found that the gas, brake pedals are offset too much to the left of my body centerline .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                   Very comfortable, quiet interior .\\n48                                                                                                                                                          Seats are padded more firmly than previous model but comfortable on trips .\\n49

                                                                                                                               Trunk is big and rear seat very comfortable for 2 and will seat 3 .\\n51

great for my 6'1  250 lbs .\\n52                                                                                                                I feel that the Camry just gets better and better in terms of comfort, styling and performance with each generation .\\n53                                                                                                                     It looks awesome, turns like it's on rails, has a great sound system, and is just comfortable and fun to drive .\\n54

comfortable front seats, better rear seat room and comfort   .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                                            Very comfortable, quite and smooth ride .\\n77                                                                              The sound system is incredible, the seats are comfortable, the controls are ergonomic and straight forward and the take off power is quite impressive .\\n78

.\\n80                                                                                                                                          It is a very comfortable car that gives us options that we never had on previous vehicles .\\n81                                               I test drove and compared similar 4 door sedans like the Maxima, Accord, Mazda6, and noticed that none had all the features,performance,comfort ,safety,and looks that the Camry has .\\n82                                                                                                                                                                                 The navigation works flawlessly, comfortable seats .\\n83

                                                                                                   The seats were very comfortable on a four and a half hour   trip, and wind and road noise were minimal .\\n86                                                                                                                                 The interior is much more comfortable than my last 3 Camrys and the exterior styling is oh so chic .\\n87

       Comfort is great, mileage is good overall, better on the road than expected  , compared to my 1999 Camry .\\n89                                                                                   Having flown 26 different aircraft and driven cars for 61 years, I find the 2007 Camry to be the most uncomfortable cockpit I have every been in .\\n90                                                                                                The headrest presses into my head at an uncomfortable angle and it is imposssible to tell where the front of the car is for parking .\\n91                                                                                                                                                              The window sill is too high and the armrest too low to be comfortable .\\n92                                                                                                        The new looks are what attracted it to me initially, but its relatively smooth drive, comfort and reliability sold me on it .\\n93                                                                                                                    It is a beautiful sapphire blue, has really nice lines, is very comfortable, is plenty peppy, and hugs the road .\\n94                             The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of leg room .\\n95

                                                               Overall this car is very quiet, comfortable, smooth, powerful, and absolutly the best mid, size in the current market .\\n97                                                                                                                                                                           Leather seats are comfortable, Nav system

and now the ride is even quieter and comfortable .\\n99                                                                                                                                                                                                     Leather seats were comfortable .\\n100

                                                 My conclusion after doing a ton of research regarding safety, reliability, comfort and gas mileage :\\n102                                                                                                                           the Hyundai Sonata is thousands of dollars cheaper and matches the Camry in all respects except comfort .\\n103                                                                                        Bottom line was that I was going to be in that driver's seat for years to come and I was not going to skimp on the critical comfort factor .\\n104                                                                                                                                                While the '03 was roomy and comfortable, the steering and handling were very vague .\\n105                           The interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields greater comfort .\\n106                                                                                                                                                   , a luxurious comfort feature, and a fuel consumption that is best in the class .\\n107

                                                                                                                                                       Top notch rating on interior comfort .\\n109

heat here in Arizona .\\n110                                                                                                                                                               Extremely

         I purchased a Camry LE approximately 2 months ago, it's a smooth comfortable ride .\\n112

to acquire satellites .\\n0    If you've ever had a  Brand X  GPS take you on some strange route that adds 20 minutes to your trip, has you turn the wrong way down a one way road, tell you to turn AFTER you've passed the street, frequently loses the satellite signal, or has old maps missing streets, you know how important this stuff is .\\n1

                                   The unit takes very quickly locks on to satellite signals, tracks very well and when you miss a turn or do something unexpected, recalculates a new route very quickly .\\n5

get satellite signals inside the tunnel .\\n7                                                           Acquiring satellites is very fast though if you are moving while the acquisition is taking place it will take a little longer to acquire a satellite and of course on a overcast day you may experience difficulty acquiring a signal though understandable .\\n8

the first 2 minutes or less, the other 10% is due to the above events .\\n9                                                                                                                                                                 And it is very fast locating satellites, the new interface needs some time to get used to, it is very cool now you can drag the map with your fingers !\\n10

         It is quick in picking up satellite signals and very responsive with the user interface   .\\n11

during the traffic jams we encountered I guess it loss contact with the satellites due to interferrence by the tall buildings arroung .\\n13                   Can pay like $200 or something and get the service for life, HotFix which allows it to get satellites much faster when booting up this is a great feature and my only complaint about past Garmins that I used which was that it took too long to acquire satellites, this eliminates that problem .\\n14                                                                                      by the time the main menu comes up after turning the device on it generally already has a full 100% signal from the satellites and it's ready to navigate, a beautiful crystal clear LCD widescreen, and tons of other features .\\n15

                          Satellite acquisition time is very fast, as is re, routing .\\n16                                                                                                                                                     It also has a  hot fix  which finds satellites faster ,  which is very useful for starting your trip immediately and great for recalculating routes very quickly

                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Good routing  , easy to use, quick to lock on to satellites .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                    But unlike my previous Garmin, the satellite acquisition is very fast, and recalculation when I deviate from the stated route is almost immediate .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Bottom line is I wanted a unit that is accurate and had reliable satellite connection .\\n37

unit out of the box .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I have noticed no problems with this unit's ability to detect satellites .\\n39                                                                                                                         It takes a little while to get the satellites sometimes, but I just set it up as soon as I get in the car and by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .\\n40

                                                                                                                                                                                                             I took the unit outside to do that, and it found the satellites very quickly .\\n42

.\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          It is much faster to find the satellite signals than my friend's TomTom 910 .\\n44

have time to really read up on the gadget so there may be features I don't know about, but just have to link it up to the satellites and off you go .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Many places in Northern Montana and especially Utah lost contact with satellite info .\\n47

                                                                                                                                                                                    large screen, text to speech street names, quick satellite fixes, and more, I think I made the best choice for my money .\\n49

the satellites .\\n50

the next day it has the satellites instantly .\\n52

the GPS off, so the next time you turn it on, it can relocate them very fast .\\n54

my van's lighter socket turned it on and it found the satellites in about 5 seconds while inside my garage .\\n56

satellite signal connection .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                               Took a few minutes for the unit to link up with the satellite, but once that was done, it was a breeze .\\n58

capture satellite signals, holding it up to the sky, outdoors .\\n59

It's fast in aquiring satellites and fast in entering addresses with a minimum of keystrokes .\\n61

I currently own, I have to say that now is the right time to consider that switch to PC .\\n7

gesture features and disk encryption that normal users won't use either because it isn't needed or the hardware isn't widely adopted yet   .\\n9

Personally I thought Vista was very handsome, what with its transparency, 3, D effects, color schemes, and usability improvements to Windows Explorer, and I believe Windows 7 continues that trend by looking just as sexy , ,  if not more , ,  while at the same time adding its own valuable features and enhancements .\\n28

of nifty features over XP that make for a more fun experience for some, and a more organized experience involving navigating huge catacombs of archives and files .\\n30

                                         Because others on this site have already described in sufficient detail all the amazing features of W7, I will not repeat them .\\n43

Features panel simply disables access to it, but the underlying program files associated with that feature remain on the hard, drive taking up space .\\n46

the auto dimming of my laptop monitors once my computer is not being used .\\n47

                                         It still works pretty good though, just a lack of some features that i had before .\\n49

low, since Microsoft OSes tend usually to be just functional   without much pizazz or many  power user  shortcuts and features, but Windows 7 really is a well, crafted OS .\\n51

I do not use most of the features, such as gaming, that seem to benefit most from the upgrade .\\n52

have cool features ?\\n53                                                                                                                              My only complaint would be that I would like to have a family pack available in the Windows Professional flavor or at least the option to purchase some of the professional features separately .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Seems like they actually stepped it down when it should have been stepped up with more features .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                I think the reason it didn't is because it wants to force the user to use the Windows Live toolbar that includes other features similar to what Google offers .\\n56

has had for a couple of years or more .\\n58                                                                                                    If you didn't come over from the bright side you would probably think these features are very cool, so enjoy them for what they are if you've never played around with a Mac enough to be comfortable in that environment .\\n59

       I am not going to review the features, because there's plenty of that already .\\n60

the screen will tilt .\\n9

.\\n10                                                                                                                                                                                                The light weight, the battery life, the keyboard, the non, protruding removable battery, the bright screen, the track pad disable button and general ease of use makes it hard to beat .\\n11

 I recommend minimizing the size of the scroll zones on the right and bottom, other wise you find the screen suddenly scrolling when you did not want it to do so .\\n12

out of a screen  , but on occasion it will zoom when you don't want or expect it to because of an inadvertent gesture or touch by a thumb, etc .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                                                        The occasional blue screen of death unfortunately has not gone away  Microsoft attributes it to an errant driver, but I have not been able to isolate what driver is the cause .\\n14

with a two, fingered gesture on the scratchpad, you can enlarge or shrink the screen .\\n36              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n37

                                       All features worked excellently for me so far especially appreciate the touchpad lock button  as well as the screen off function key .\\n42

                                 the screen is STUNNING, and if you've got a bright light shining down on it, you've got a choice :\\n44

                                     you can either move the screen to eliminate the glare, or move the lamp .\\n45

screen and make the occasional adjustment for glare, than deal with a matte screen 24 7 .\\n46

come across is how for some, the screen doesn't tilt back far enough .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              yeah, you'd probably want the screen to tilt far enough back to lay flat .\\n48                                                            And if you can't wait to twist yourself into some contortion in bed where you need the screen to go back further than reasonable, you can always invest in one of those $20 lap desks ,  you know, the kind with the beanbag bottom, so that you can shift the desk into whatever ridiculous position will suit your fancy .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  and I could have gotten a matte screen, but neither of those  features  impressed me .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                                Except for difficulties seeing the entire New York Times crossword puzzle all at once on the screen, the Asus satisfies my needs and seems about as fast as my 5, year, old IBM laptop .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I was also nervous about the fact that occasionally the image on the computer screen  shivered , although it normally recovered from that .\\n52

                                                      The screen is too small for any meaningful work, but the apps DO work .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Again, the screen is too small for this to be anything more than just satisfying from a purchase standpoint .\\n56

fingerprint magnet, and the glossy screen can be a bit of a problem in some lighting conditions .\\n57

installed the two gb ram and tried to turn it on and the screen remained blank .\\n58

                                     The most noticeable difference is the screen and keyboard functionality .\\n87

easily, more if I turn off WIFI and turn down the screen brightness .\\n89   One of the downside I have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n90

too cramped .\\n92

                   Having the touchpad feature of expanding zooming the presentation on the screen is a nice feature, but I have to admit having never needing to use it   .\\n94                                                                                                                                                                                                               And it goes in that bag wrapped in the white paper plastic bag it was originally boxed up in, with another piece of packing plastic between the keyboard and the screen .\\n95

                                  The screen rotation angle is good enough for putting the netbook on desktop .\\n138

should have been designed to be able to rotate all the way back to inline with the keyboard .\\n139

The screen is very bright and sharp with a maximum resolution of 1024x600 .\\n140

keyboard is only slightly smaller than a regular one .\\n141

quickly, especially after getting rid of the extra asus software that auto, boots at startup, its battery life is phenomenal, the screen is clear and easy to read, the keyboard is comfortable to type on and feels natural .\\n143                                                                                                                                               But even with that, and the glossy screen, fingerprint magnet, limited screen tilt, tinny speakers, and intermittent odd glitches, I still think it's a great value and would buy it again today if I were on the market for a netbook .\\n144

  I thought it would be fitting to christen my Kindle with the Stephen King novella UR, so went to the Amazon site on my computer and clicked on the button to buy it .\\n0                                                                                                                                                                                                            As soon as I'd clicked the

reading through the introductory guide that loads up automatically at the start and following along it took me almost no time to learn which buttons are where and what each of them do .\\n2                                                   I started reading with the default size without my glasses and noticed I was squinting a bit, so changed to one size larger with a couple button clicks and it was much easier without feeling like the print was too big and took up too much of the page .\\n3

.\\n4                                                                                                                                                  It took very little time to get used to having to push a button to turn pages and the screen flash as they turn only really startled me the first few times .\\n5                                                                                                                                 I don't feel the need to push the button ahead of time to prepare for the end of the page at all, which evidently a lot of Kindle 1 owners do since it's a bit more sluggish .\\n6                                                unintended page changes, the awkward way I sometimes have to hold it to keep from hitting buttons, the sometimes slow page refresh, and the screen freezes that now has me traveling with a paper clip lest I need to do a reset while commuting on the train .\\n7

to put the device to sleep .\\n8

interior of the button to get it to click .\\n10

button at the top of the Kindle is really a power slide .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                                                 The change in the hinging and size of the buttons is major plus and would make it hard to go back to the K1 .\\n13                                                                                                                                                 sleeker look and feel  , sharper screen, no longer accidentally depressing the next page button by accident and having to find your place in the book again .\\n14                                                                                                                                                                           ,  The 5, way button, though a bit small, allows you to select left and right, and not just up and down like the original version .\\n15                                                                                                       Only issue is I need to recalibrate now, , in general, I try to anticipate how much time it will take the next page to load, and when I'm two lines from the bottom, I would hit the next page button .\\n16

.\\n19                                                                                                                                                                     I like to read holding the Kindle with one hand and it just didn't work well because I kept bumping the next, previous and back buttons .\\n20

major improvement .\\n21

sometimes pulled the battery door off .\\n23

Yet changing pages is effortless when you do ,  the buttons are right between your thumbs and the slightest pressure on their faces is enough to activate them .\\n26                                                                                                          That it doesn't have the quirky, clunky, annoying buttons that filled \\u00be of each side of its predecessor, buttons that caused dozens upon dozens of accidental page turns makes it that much sexier .\\n27

hit one of the obscenely large buttons and advance or retreat one, two, three, or even four pages .\\n31

                       With the Kindle 1, I was constantly at risk of accidentally bumping the next page buttons .\\n33

took a little getting used to after having used the Kindle 1, especially since the context menus that I was used to in the first gen have changed due to the new directional button, but for any Kindle user, this change is a god send .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                  It looks good, feels good in the hand, has good buttons, which are easy to operate on purpose but not so easy accidentally .\\n37

                                                         The button layout looks odd because it's so regularly spaced in rows versus the keyboard's staggered style, but it isn't any harder to use than a cellphone's tri, letter entry or blackberry keyboard .\\n40

      Just like how I prefer to grasp the page a few sentences before the end of a page, I tend to press the  Next Page  button a bit sooner than I finish reading the page .\\n43

I could ever physically flip any book page without shearing it from the spine .\\n44

its awkward to hold and feels unbalanced in my hands, almost like it will tip over .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                                             When I'm trying to go to the next page, I hit the home button by accident a lot .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I also hate the fact that you really have to push the buttons hard to change the page .\\n61                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I really liked the extra responsiveness of the K1 buttons   .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                                                            However I was disappointed to discover that I was unable to press the buttons from that position .\\n63                                                                                                                                                                                             With the K2 I can turn on the TTS feature with one button, place it beside me, and have it read to me all night !\\n64                                                                                                                                                                                        I contemplated changes to my beloved Kindle with dread, I was one of the few who loved the old page, turning buttons .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I worried that the new buttons would be Sony Reader size, and impossible for me to press .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                   Thankfully the buttons are still at least thumb, size, and may appear hard to press, until you realize that they are hinged on the inside .\\n67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I like the new size and feel of the buttons .\\n68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  It is much harder now to accidentally hit the page buttons .\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                                                               But holding the darn thing was a chore without pressing that next button page .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Kind of hard to do when you're inadvertently pressing buttons .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                              Also the keyboard has been redesigned to make things easier as well as added buttons like  menu  which is nice .\\n72                                                                                                                                            I find myself using a large size typeface to compensate for the lack of contrast, but this means frequent  next page  button presses which is extremely annoying .\\n73                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The buttons have a cheap feel .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The  next page  buttons should activate when pressed at any angle .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Upgrade the quality of the hardware especially the buttons .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You can pretty much figure everything out by just trying the buttons .\\n77                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The next, previous, back buttons are much smaller and are hard to hit accidentally .\\n78                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The keyboard buttons are small, round, low, profile and have slightly convex tops .\\n79                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The on, off button is now on top and the radio on, off switch is now in a software menu .\\n80                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The Kindle 1 roller button and quirky silver navigation bar are gone .\\n81                                                                                                                                                                                      My thanks to  Arts&HistoryFan  for pointing out that when you hit the menu button, the time is shown in the top banner .\\n82                                                                                                       Yes, I noticed some of the initial design flaws in the first, generation Kindle ,  the placement of the  next page  buttons, the general sense of flimsiness ,  but I decided I could live with those .\\n83                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Opened the box, press the button and it begins downloading books that I pre, ordered .\\n84                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The welcome screen comes on to explain all the buttons .\\n85                                                                                                                                                                               One thing I didn't like was the page next button failed to work when the text to speech was in use and I wanted to skip ahead .\\n86                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             sym button depressed at same time\\n87                                                                                                                                                                 Buttons are accessible, raised for convenience of all involved ,  another big plus for the visually impaired or those with other conditions .\\n88                                                                                       The sound button is raised only slightly ,  fine for VI but potentially problematic for those with arthritis or other issues with fine motor function as it is a relatively thin button that must be pressed slightly .\\n89                                                                                                                                                                                        The buttons are well placed and need a good push to change pages, but not so much that it detracts from your reading .\\n90                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Navigation is much easier with the 5, way button .\\n91                                                                                                                                                               I miss having a dedicated button to deactivate the wireess, but the overall device has improved so much that I will get over the loss quickly .\\n92

use the feature .\\n96

                                                        My one complaint is that I'd like a  previous page  button on both side of the screen, the way there's a  next page  button on both sides, but that's a very minor consideration .\\n113                                                                                                                                             Reading the book
